        THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF TWITTER

        A tragedy in one act




THE ABSTRACT.: UM moves onto the Sweet 16 üôåüôåüôå
  just trying to make it.
  sometimes sitting back and just listening is the best thing to do.
  take it in stride and progress.
  come back down to earth.
  "...shouldn't I realize, you're the highest of the high  if you don't know, then I'll say it  so don't ever wonder."
  Christina Yang, I definitely didn't notice that the tweet dismissed the women's tourney üò≥
  Zeke, they have been missing shots like crazy and only down by 10. a comeback is very possible.
  annoyed.
  even though we lost tonight, I'm proud of what UM did this season. ACC Champs &amp; they made it to the Sweet 16. a rarity for UM basketball.
  that was a really deep 3 with a hand in his face. wow!
  welp... another one of those nights.
  looks like another nice day in beantown.
  7 days Marisa Gee üòè
  i miss album covers like that.all no limit albums shouldve been on it RT Charlie Greene Lance Dixon the abstract. this little flip one though
  23Shep, Lance Dixon Stephen Francis I plan to find someone to stay with, spent enough on the tickets lol.
  Jonathan Wall, I'm out here trying to be like you man lol.
  big krit is one of the best rapper/producers of all time.
  ÈæçÁæÖÁ¨õ, you have to listen to an entire project, a few songs won't do justice. listen to return of 4eva or king remembered in time.
  ... rip it's the remix killer, if mike jack was alive I'd remix thriller"
  idk why, but I think that line is really dope.
  Lance Dixon, thanks for checking up bro, I'm down in Atlanta now so I'm alright.
  it's crazy that I was in the area of the explosion a few days ago. prayers up to everyone in beantown.
  here comes the rain..

  well this makes sense. RT Armando Salguero: The Dolphins see Dion Jordan as another Jason Taylor.
  lazy friday night.
  I don't like the Knicks, but I like seeing the celtics lose.
  "...can't stop I, from drinkin mai-tai, with ta ta, down in nevada, ha ha, papa, word life"
  jay-z x reasonable doubt
  the sun come out and people forget to put deodorant on... c'mon son.
  "... traffic traffic, glad I got my chap stick, feeling kinda car sick, there's a Ford Maverick."
  I've had the craziest toothache for the past few hours, this is terrible üò©
  that right jab is killin Guerrero.
  Floyd is too quick.
  yea, this is over.
  Guerrero needs to start taking chances now, he is holding back a lot of shots. he has nothing to lose at this point.
  "... flying high in the friendly sky."
  habits &amp; contradictions.
  well, alright..
  well, now that I'm wide awake. what to do now?

  23Shep, I'm about to do the same. we left before she came on. they should've stopped it earlier than they did.
  23Shep, Lance Dixon Stephen Francis I would've been right there with y'all lol.
  the Heat are not losing this game.
  nan. I wish I was home.
  "... in a french ass restaurant, hurry up with my damn croissants."

  dom kennedy is one of the most consistent rappers out. when was the last time you heard a bad dom kennedy song?
  @KevinUncut, you don't know much about hip-hop...
  I remember now why I stay off twitter, everyone is an expert...
  @KevinUncut, smh...
  got a solid 11 hours of sleep last night which is probably more than I had the rest of the week.
  Charlie Greene, dope article bro, you forgot about the Jay Elec signing though lol.
  Nas' response to "Let Nas Down" is classic hip-hop.
  r.kelly got hits.
  blu &amp; exile x give me my flowers while I can still smell them [album]
  July is the Saturday of summer.
  Chuck the Efficient , Born Sinner &gt; All other Cole projects. the production was on point and more substance. I still think he should start working...
  Chuck the Efficient , with other producers, shit starts to sound the same if you do everything on your own.
  Chuck the Efficient , I think Yeezus was solid, ahead of the curve. more people are going to start to use that sound in hip-hop now. ok, that's it lol
  Complex , I read complex enough, I know you guys are just as sad as I am.
  just saw "let me explain," Kevin Hart is funny as hell. and since no one is taking stand up serious like him he has whole lane to himself.
  "... stereotypes of a black male misunderstood, but it's still all good."
  I'm baffled.
  Two rap songs everyone should know all the lyrics to : Ice Cube - It was a good day and Biggie- Juicy
  I gotta start tweeting again.
  I rarely use this thing anymore
  y'all see me more often.
  yasiin bae., really? I thought they were zombies too..
  "... show em better than I can tell em, they gon feel me"
  happy birthday to my bro 23Shep. live up to your nickname tonight lol.
  hey young world.
  you know my steez..
  all in together now, things are looking better now.
  in a midst of confusion lol.
  anyone else excited about the return of Breaking Bad?
  I have a feeling that the last 8 episodes are going to be epic.
  23Shep, I read they pulled out all of the stops for the final 8, we can't lose.
  I've been waiting for that moment. The battle of Walt and Hank begins..
  Thank you Kendrick Lamar for bringing back healthy competition in hip-hop. keepin these rappers on they toes.
  think back 10-15 years ago and how exciting hip-hop was. Everyone was trying to show how much better they were than the competition.
  You gotta take down the best to be the best.
  "...yelling YOLO was a lie, and you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young"
  YoungBarbancourt, He knows Jesse actually might kill him, he has nothing to lose!
  Its crazy how much Skylar's character has changed. She used to hate Walt, now she ordering hits
  YoungBarbancourt, but now it's looking like he going to snitch.
  Suelz, my bad üòÖ
  happy birthday to the homie Jonathan Wall. I hope it's been a good one.
  23Shep, something in me didn't want that to happen. I want Walt to go out on his own terms.
  Hank using Jesse as bait.. this will be interesting.
  welp..
  thank God for DVR. RT 23Shep: Just realized that tomorrow night tv-wise is about to be a problem once it hits 9 pm.
  23Shep, I feel that, I know for a fact I'll be watching it.
  that was such a terrible pass.
  Ron Livingston Jr. , I'm sure that's what the game plan is becoming. Morris just needs to manage the game.
  that's definitely a fumble.
  we have to get some points out of the drive.
  I can't get over how weird it looks with Devin Gardner wearing 98. it's for a great reason though so I respect it.

GUCCI VALENTINE: blacky miles, I'm 28 and have a daughter. That shit looks like filth and screams, " I'm fast".
