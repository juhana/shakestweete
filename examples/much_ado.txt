   zahri, yo man, I have z e r o energy to do anything but stalk people on twitter

LAUREN BELLAFLORES: "And then he vanished into the night, like the smoke that escaped from his cigarettes."

DANIELA SANTIAGO:  zahri, Im always too tired to wash my face at night and I always have to think to myself "do ya wanna break out tomorrow morning?"

ALYSSA HOOD: It's bad when you can tell you're gonna be really hungover in the morning Shannan O'Dowd

  Why somebody always in my seat when I'm trying to fly back to NYC??!! This time it was the little girl from a previous tweet.
  I let her keep it so she could be with her mother, she's never flown before so it would be scary not to have her!
  "Please give them your attention as they demonstrate the in flight safet....." Nope.
  Apparently passing out and falling asleep will take care of the ear popping. Night night.
  Figured out the wifi. It's only free for 30 minutes which is rude but it's all good considering I will only be on the plane for that long
  I find this so exciting OMG
  Casually listening to Pippin the Musical on my flight back to NYC just wishing I could get up and start dancing!!!
