  Kes, Minds Like Ours ignorant people who try to put you down :)
  Callum Carson, Minds Like Ours Thank you Callum, that means the world!
  Matt Beat, Thank you Matt - that means so much to me and encourages me to keep writing. I hope you are well :)

AMY DELLOW: So stressed. Roll on a weekend of partying followed by recieving my student loan and spending every penny on making myself feel sane again üòã

MEL BANES: Shawn Kitts, James Arthur Glad we can agree then, I just think if you are that offended that easy don't listen to music like that

GEORGIA STEPHENSON: someone take me to Disneyland.

SALLIE AXL: Obvs not in too house music??? Hmmm
  David B Forshaw, it's a song babe

UBERFACTS: People who laugh more are better able to tolerate pain - Both physical and emotional.
  Men and women who listen to more music tend to be better communicators and even have longer lasting relationships.

ABIGAAAAAAIL: so.. some like 14 year olds moved our food bin outside when they saw me they started to walk away, my reaction? do the wanker sign at them
  then they stood outside for at least 5 minutes air humping and i was actually cracking up then as soon as i called jack they all run

UBERFACTS: There‚Äôs actually a word for the day after tomorrow -- Overmorrow.

ELLIS LYNN SPICER: Abigaaaaaail, moving the food bin? shit is that what teenage rebellion is these days? No graffiti, no vandalising, bin moving

ABIGAAAAAAIL: Ellis Lynn Spicer, tell me about it fam!! It all happened so fast! The little rebs! Haha

ELLIS LYNN SPICER: Abigaaaaaail, gosh I think we're used to a higher class of teenage rebs in Essex....watch out the Canterbury bin moving teens are about!

ABIGAAAAAAIL: Ellis Lynn Spicer, exactly what i thought! not the food bin, alas i would miss it so much!
